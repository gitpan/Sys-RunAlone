	Given up after almost a week getting the test to complete without
	errors.  Added two TODO sections: manual testing indicates that
	everything seems to work as it should, so I guess it must be some
	test-suite artefact causing problems.

	20 March 2008
	Added support for SKIP_SYS_RUNALONE environment variable to skip the
	functionality altogether.  After a feature request by Rick Jansen.
	Made the code a little more adhering to PBP.

	Why did testing just go ok and wrong now?  Argh, must be too late.
	Fix for warning and test error.

0.06	15 November 2006
	Brought up to BPB standards.  Made the error message if no DATA handle
	found, hopefully more understandable.

0.05	11 June 2006
	Added caveat of scripts being edited.

0.04	11 July 2005
	Some pod fixes.  Added link to Sys::RunAlways.

0.03	10 June 2005
	Oops. Still one more race condition to fix in test-suite.

0.02	10 June 2005
	Hopefully fixed problem with race conditions in the test-suite.
